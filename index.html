		<h2>Web Design: Unit 2</h2>
		<p>Over my second unit of Web Design, I mainly learned about the simple tags that you can use in html to format your website, such as lists or tables. Here are some things I found particularly interesting.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>There are several kinds of tags that format even basic layouts</li>
			<li>Lists can be made using numbered or bulleted formats</li>
			<li>Links can be created for different websites, web pages in your website, or different locations on the same page</li>
			<li>Data tables are very useful for portraying information and can be created with a large amount of customization</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Web Design: Unit 3</h2>
		<p>During my third unit of Web Design, I learned much more about CSS, including how to style different elements, such as paragraphs, lists, tables, and more. I also learned about organizing and shaping a website using margins, padding, and text-align to create a professional looking website. Here are some things I found particularly interesting.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You can use the colors of a website to help convey it's message and theme.</li>
			<li>You can use CSS to change the color of different parts of the same element, such as the background color, text color, or margin color.</li>
			<li>CSS can be used to completely change the look of an element, such as when I changed my Nav from a simple unordered list, into a set of buttons above the main body.</li>
			<li>You can change the style of individual elements of the website, such as the style of the margin, the style of the text, or even the style of embedded links.</li>
		</ul>
